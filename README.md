## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Plugin doesn't appear in Vencord settings
- Make sure the file is named exactly `index.tsx`
- Verify the file is in the correct folder: `userplugins/HypeSquadSwitcher/index.tsx`
- Restart Discord completely

### Command doesn't work
- Ensure the plugin is enabled in Vencord settings
- Try typing `/` to see if the command appears in the autocomplete

### "Request failed" error
- This usually means Discord's API rejected the request
- Wait a few seconds and try again
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection

### Badge doesn't update immediately
- Discord may take a few seconds to update your profile
- Try refreshing Discord (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`)
- Check your profile to confirm the change
